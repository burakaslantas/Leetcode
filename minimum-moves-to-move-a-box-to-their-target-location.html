Minimum Moves to Move a Box to Their Target Location</div>
**********************************************************<div class="content__u3I1 question-content__JfgR"><div><p>Storekeeper is a game in which the player pushes boxes around in a warehouse trying to get them to target locations.</p>
<p>The game is represented by a <code>grid</code> of size <code>m x n</code>, where each element is a wall, floor, or a box.</p>
<p>Your task is move the box <code>'B'</code> to the target position <code>'T'</code> under the following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Player is represented by character <code>'S'</code> and can move up, down, left, right in the <code>grid</code> if it is a floor (empy cell).</li>
<li>Floor is represented by character <code>'.'</code> that means free cell to walk.</li>
<li>Wall is represented by character <code>'#'</code> that means obstacle  (impossible to walk there). </li>
<li>There is only one box <code>'B'</code> and one target cell <code>'T'</code> in the <code>grid</code>.</li>
<li>The box can be moved to an adjacent free cell by standing next to the box and then moving in the direction of the box. This is a <strong>push</strong>.</li>
<li>The player cannot walk through the box.</li>
</ul>
<p>Return the minimum number of <strong>pushes</strong> to move the box to the target. If there is no way to reach the target, return <code>-1</code>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> grid = [["#","#","#","#","#","#"],
               ["#","T","#","#","#","#"],
               ["#",".",".","B",".","#"],
               ["#",".","#","#",".","#"],
               ["#",".",".",".","S","#"],
               ["#","#","#","#","#","#"]]
<strong>Output:</strong> 3
<strong>Explanation: </strong>We return only the number of times the box is pushed.</pre>
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong> grid = [["#","#","#","#","#","#"],

               ["#","T",".",".","#","#"],
               ["#",".","#","B",".","#"],
               ["#",".",".",".",".","#"],
               ["#",".",".",".","S","#"],
               ["#","#","#","#","#","#"]]
<strong>Output:</strong> 5
<strong>Explanation:</strong>  push the box down, left, left, up and up.
